I'm an engineer :). I've been programming for over three decades and have managed lots of engineering teams working on things like ASICs, PBCs, firmware as well as large scale distributed software. These days I'm particularly interested in machine learning/AI.

I'm on the advisory board of the [Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology](https://scet.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, and helped create the [Alt.meat lab](https://altmeatlab.berkeley.edu/) there. I'm looking forward to the day where we no longer create massive animal suffering to feed ourselves.
