I read a lot (30-50 books per year) and while most of then are not that special, many of these books have changed how I think. Sometime books are able to articulate thoughts you already had in a much clearer way, but sometimes they open totally new worlds and change the way you live.

Here is a list of my favorite books and why. This will be a living post that I will change over time.

### Management/Innovation
* [The Innovators Dilemma](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Change-Business/dp/0062060244) by Clayton M. Christensen.
* [Dealing with Darwin](https://www.amazon.com/Dealing-Darwin-Companies-Innovate-Evolution/dp/159184214X) by Geoffrey A. Moore. 
* [Certain to Win](https://www.amazon.com/Certain-Win-Strategy-Applied-Business-ebook/dp/B0793SDYSM) by Chet Richards.
This book covers the work of [John Boyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(military_strategist)) who was a fighter pilot and military strategist.

There are probably better books about Buddhism, but this one was the first one I read and it simply connected with me where I was at that time. It opened up a world to me I simply had no idea existed. It was a key part in me becoming an vegetarian.
