I read a lot and while most of them are not that special, many of these books have changed how I think. Sometimes books are able to articulate thoughts you already had in a much clearer way, but often they open totally new worlds and change the way you live.

Here are a few of my favorite books. This will be a living post that I will change over time.


## Some Classics
* [The Voyage of the Beagle][1] by Charles Darwin. This is a easy to read travel blog. You can see him make the observations that for the basis of his 'Origin of Species'.
* [The Prince][14] by Niccolò Machiavelli is worth reading as occasionally you will encounter people that actually seem to live according to this book. If you do, run as fast away from them as you can. After reading it though you will need an antidote. I do not know a better one than [The Little Prince][15]
* [Guns, Germs and Steel][17], by Jared Diamond

## Management/Innovation
There are some basic books that are I think mandatory reads, even if a lot of the concepts are common knowledge:
* [The Innovators Dilemma][2] by Clayton M. Christensen.
* [Dealing with Darwin][3] by Geoffrey A. Moore. 

Sometimes military literature gives really good insights.
* [US Marine Corps: Warfighting][4]. I'm not a military person, but this doctrine document is extraordinary well written and contains lots of deep wisdom one how to manage teams in difficult and uncertain situations. 
* [Certain to Win][5] by Chet Richards. This book covers the work of [John Boyd][6] who was a fighter pilot and military strategist. His main insight was that the speed of iteration between observation and action is the most critical factor.

## Technology
* The two books that I studied in college that gave me a deeper insight into the design of computers and that remained useful over the years are [Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach][7] by Hennessy and Patterson and [The dragon book][8] on Compiler design by Aho, Sethi and Ullman.
* [Gödel, Escher, Bach][12] by Douglas Hofstadter opened my mind to so many crazy ideas around recursion and the idea of Gödel. 
* On the practical side [Practical Deep Learning for coders][13] is simply _the_ best way to get into deep learning. Jeremy Howard's approach to teaching a complicated topic is incredible. 
* ["Can Machines Think?" aka Computing Machinery and Intelligence][16] by Allen Turing is remarkably approachable and contains enormous insight. 

## Philosophy
* [Awakening the Buddha Within: Tibetan Wisdom for the Western World][9] by Lama Surya Das.
There are probably more prominent books about Buddhism, but this one was the first one I read and it simply connected with me where I was at that time. It opened up a world to me I simply had no idea existed. It was a key part in me becoming an vegetarian.
* [A Plea for the Animals][10] by Matthieu Ricard.
* [Animal Liberation][11] by Peter Singer. It is a classic and the starting point for many people on their vegan journey.
* Not a book, but Michael Sandel's [Harvard's Justice Course][18] is simply amazing. It is easy to absorb and it introduced me to many philosophers.  
* [What a Fish Knows: The Inner Lives of Our Underwater Cousins][19] might not really be a philosophy book, but it really opened by eyes to the wonder of Fish. I knew, and still know, so little about these amazing animals.


## Fiction
* Asimov's Foundation and Robots series.
* Iain Banks Culture books. In particular I liked 'The Player of Games'.
* Lord of the Rings, obviously.
