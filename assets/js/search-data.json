            "content": "I read a lot (30-50 books per year) and while most of then are not that special, many of these books have changed how I think. Sometime books are able to articulate thoughts you already had in a much clearer way, but sometimes they open totally new worlds and change the way you live. . Here is a list of my favorite books and why. This will be a living post that I will change over time. . Management/Innovation . The Innovators Dilemma by Clayton M. Christensen. | Dealing with Darwin by Geoffrey A. Moore. | Certain to Win by Chet Richards. This book covers the work of John Boyd who was a fighter pilot and military strategist. | US Marine Corsp: Warfighting. I’m not a military person, but this doctrine document is extraordinary well written and contains lots of deep wisdom one how to manage teams in difficult and uncertain situations. | . Coding/Technology . Computing Architectures | Beautiful Code | Compilers | Deep Learning for coders | Code Complete | . Philosophy . Awakening the Buddha Within: Tibetan Wisdom for the Western World by Lama Surya Das. There are probably better books about Buddhism, but this one was the first one I read and it simply connected with me where I was at that time. It opened up a world to me I simply had no idea existed. It was a key part in me becoming an vegetarian. | A Plea for the Animals: The Moral, Philosophical, and Evolutionary Imperative to Treat All Beings with Compassion by Matthieu Ricard. | Animal Liberation by Peter Singer. | . Classics . The prince | The little prince | Art of War | . Fiction . Asimov foundation and robots series | Iain Banks Culture books. In particular The Player of Games | LOTR | .",

I’ve been programming for over three decades and have managed lots of engineering teams working on things like ASICs, PBCs, Firmware as well as large scale distributed software. These days I’m particularly interested in machine learning/AI. . I’m on the advisory board of the Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology at UC Berkeley, and helped create the Alt.meat lab there. I’m looking forward to the day where we no longer create massive animal suffering to feed ourselves. .",
